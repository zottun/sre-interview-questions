# sre-interview-questions

This repository contains a number of technical questions that are for use in the SRE interview process at ClearScore.
    Not all questions are relevant to every candidate - we will inform you as to which questions we would like you 
    to complete. 
    
Don't be worried if you can't complete all the questions we ask - some of them are deliberately difficult! If you don't 
    have a complete answer to any of them, feel free to submit whatever thoughts or code that you do have!


#### How do I submit my answers?

You may have answered the questions in a number of different ways - you may have diagrams, code, text documents etc.
    Please zip any files up and return to *Joe Carpenter* and *Barry Laffoy* by email. You should be given contact 
    details when you are given a link to the test.
